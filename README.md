# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV-Image-Video-
This project demonstrates Face Detection using Python and OpenCV. It can detect human faces in both images and videos by using the Haar Cascade Classifier — a pre-trained model for facial recognition.

# Features

✅ Detects faces in static images
✅ Performs real-time face detection in videos (frame by frame)
✅ Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
✅ Saves the processed output video
✅ Works perfectly on Google Colab or any Python environment
